**Basic Install Steps**
1. Install linuxCNC which as of now is https://www.linuxcnc.org/iso/LinuxCNC_2.9.2-amd64.hybrid.iso from https://linuxcnc.org/downloads/
    * The default image from downloads is actually from RodW as of today 1/17/2024 and includes the repos for Probe Basic + EtherCAT https://forum.linuxcnc.org/9-installing-linuxcnc/49819-debian-12-bookworm-live-installer-iso-for-linuxcnc-x86-64

    If like me upon trying to update / upgrade you get errors about raspi-firmware then run these lines...[ as explained here](https://forum.linuxcnc.org/9-installing-linuxcnc/49819-debian-12-bookworm-live-installer-iso-for-linuxcnc-x86-64?start=110#290983)
    ```
    rm /etc/{initramfs/post-update.d/,kernel/{postinst.d/,postrm.d/}}z50-raspi-firmware
    apt purge raspi-firmware
    ```

3. Install EtherCAT https://forum.linuxcnc.org/ethercat/45336-ethercat-installation-from-repositories-how-to-step-by-step

    -- you dont need to run the hidden (spoiler) commands on that page
   
    -- you may have to create the dev directory in your home folder - I did not have one

    -- after ```sudo halcompile --install cia402.comp``` you should be able to move onto the next step of testing with the Delta B3 config from gchesney

4. Example Delta B3 config [https://github.com/gchesney/linuxcnc-asda-b3-e-configs](https://github.com/gchesney/linuxcnc-asda-b3-e-configs)

    * Adjust "setp cia402.0.pos-scale 10000000" in ethercat-test.hal to have some visible movement
    * Delta ASDA-Soft to disable the limits + emergency stop inputs if you desire 
        *P2.011 through 13 to disabled - otherwise you will always have the AL013 alarm - you should have Estop in a real machine
        *If running from a single phase supply during testing you will also have to disable some of the low voltage alarms..

**Setup Notes**

* XRDP works okay as remote desktop server
  * the user needs to be logged out locally to be able to login via RDP

* Delta files download: https://downloadcenter.deltaww.com/en-US/DownloadCenter?v=1&CID=06&itemID=060201&downloadID=B3%20Series&sort_expr=cdate&sort_dir=DESC
  *  Delta ASDA-Soft allows you to configure 1000s of settings and view very useful debugging information on the drives
  * I havent found out how to actually get the firmware update files - maybe they must be requested from Delta..

* The HAL Scope is cool!! Use the x-drv-act-velo to get some neat torque curves

* USB isolator to avoid encoder errors while configuring drive via USB, I assume from ground loops https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256801182770545.html
